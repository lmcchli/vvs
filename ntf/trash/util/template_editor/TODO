TemplateEditor.java is a prototype of a graphical tool for editing
NTF text template files. It is not complete. Things to do:

* Rename class from Phrase1 to TemplateEditor
* Makefile
* Modify NTF, so TextCreator has a method that can generate a text using
  properties supplied as a parameter instead of read automagically from 
  phrase files.
