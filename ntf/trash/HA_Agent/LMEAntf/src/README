Short description of the HA-part of NTF.
Lennart Rasmusson
================================================================

The interface between NTF and the cluster has the following operations:
- Start NTF
- Stop NTF
- Check the NTF environment
- Probe the sanity of running NTF

When NTF is running, the processes are monitored by PMF (process monitoring facility) of the cluster.

The programs in the NTF HA part are:

- ntf_svc_start         Starts NTF, using hantf_ntf and hantf_agt.
- ntf_svc_stop          Stops NTF with kill.
- ntf_validate          Checks that the NTF cluster environment is OK. It checks the HA setup and that
                        the start scripts exist and are executable.
- ntf_update            Informs NTF of configuration changes in the cluster environment by restarting.
- ntf_monitor_start     Starts the NTF probe.
- ntf_monitor_stop      Stops the NTF probe.
- ntf_monitor_check     Same as ntf_validate.
- ntf_probe             Checks the sanity of NTF. Currently a no-op.
- hantf-agt.sh          Shell script that starts the NTF subagent.
- hantf-ntf.sh          Shell script that starts the NTF java process.

All the functionality is implemented in ntf.c. The other c-files are only wrappers for the commands, 
that call functions in ntf.c.
