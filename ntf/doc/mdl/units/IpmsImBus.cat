|This is the SNMP Version 1 Interface.
|
|SNMP includes the following protocol operations:
| get retrieves specified information;
| getnext used for table row retrieval and for discovery of managed objects;
| set changes the value of specified information;
| trap signals to a manager that an event of importance has occurred.
|
|SNMP, SIMPLE NETWORK MANAGEMENT PROTOCOL
|The simple network management protocol is an application protocol by which the variables of an agent's MIB may be inspected or altered.
|Communication among protocol entities is accomplished by the exchange of messages, each of which is entirely and independently represented within a single UDP datagram using the basic encoding rules of ASN.1. A message consists of a version identifier, an SNMP community name, and a protocol data unit (PDU).
|It is mandatory that all implementations of SNMP support the five PDUs: GetRequest-PDU, GetNextRequest-PDU, GetResponse-PDU, SetRequest-PDU, and Trap-PDU.
|
|SNMP OPERATIONAL MODEL
|SNMP is based on a connection less client-server model. The management station is the client and the management agent is the server.
|The top-level actions of a protocol entity that generates a message are as follows:
|1. It first constructs the appropriate PDU, e.g., the GetRequest-PDU, as an ASN.1 object.
|2. It then passes this ASN.1 object along with a community name its source transport address and the destination transport address, to the service which implements the desired authentication scheme. This authentication service returns another ASN.1 object.
|3. The protocol entity then constructs an ASN.1 Message object, using the community name and the resulting ASN.1 object.
|4. This new ASN.1 object is then serialized, using the basic encoding rules of ASN.1, and then sent using a transport service to the peer protocol entity.
|Similarly, the top-level actions of a protocol entity which receives a message are as follows:
|1. It performs a rudimentary parse of the incoming datagram to build an ASN.1 object corresponding to an ASN.1 Message object. If the parse fails, it discards the datagram and performs no further actions.
|2. It then verifies the version number of the SNMP message. If there is a mismatch, it discards the datagram and performs no further actions.
|3. The protocol entity then passes the community name and user data found in the ASN.1 Message object, along with the datagram's source and destination transport addresses to the service which implements the desired authentication scheme. This entity returns another ASN.1 object, or signals an authentication failure. In the latter case, the protocol entity notes this failure,(possibly) generates a trap, and discards the datagram and performs no further actions.
|4. The protocol entity then performs a rudimentary parse on the ASN.1 object returned from the authentication service to build an ASN.1 object corresponding to an ASN.1 PDUs object. If the parse fails, it discards the datagram and performs no further actions. Otherwise, using the named SNMP community, the appropriate profile is selected, and the PDU is processed accordingly. If, as a result of this processing, a message is returned then the source transport address that the response message is sent from shall be identical to the destination transport address that the original request message was sent to.
|
|MAPPING ONTO TRANSPORT SERVICES
|SNMP PDUs are mapped on to a connection less datagram transport using UDP.
|A protocol entity receives messages at UDP port 161 on the host with which it is associated for all messages except for those which report traps (i.e., all messages except those which contain the Trap-PDU). Messages, which report traps, should be received on UDP port 162 for further processing. 
|
|
|PROTOCOL ELEMENT ENCODING
|Management information communicated by operation of SNMP is represented according to the subset of the ASN.1 language.
|Also for the sake of simplicity, the SNMP uses only a subset of the basic encoding rules of ASN.1. Namely, all encodings use the definite-length form. Further, whenever permissible, non-constructor encodings are used rather than constructor encodings. This restriction applies to all aspects of ASN.1 encoding, both for the top-level protocol data units and the data objects they contain.
|
|USERS
|Normally, all components part of the MXE system will use the SNMP protocol.

|The GetRequest-PDU
|The GetRequest-PDU is generated by a protocol entity only at the request of its SNMP application entity. Upon receipt of the GetRequest-PDU, the receiving protocol entity responds according to any applicable rule in the list below:
|1. If, for any object named in the variable-bindings field, the object's name does not exactly match the name of some object available for get operations in the relevant MIB view, then the receiving entity sends to the originator of the received message the GetResponse-PDU of identical form, except that the value of the error-status field is noSuchName, and the value of the error-index field is the index of said object name component in the received message.
|2. If, for any object named in the variable-bindings field, the object is an aggregate type (as defined in the SMI), then the receiving entity sends to the originator of the received message the GetResponse-PDU of identical form, except that the value of the error-status field is noSuchName, and the value of the error-index field is the index of said object name component in the received message.
|3. If the size of the GetResponse-PDU generated as described below would exceed a local limitation, then the receiving entity sends to the originator of the received message the GetResponse-PDU of identical form, except that the value of the error-status field is tooBig, and the value of the error-index field is zero.
|4. If, for any object named in the variable-bindings field, the value of the object cannot be retrieved for reasons not covered by any of the foregoing rules, then the receiving entity sends to the originator of the received message the GetResponse-PDU of identical form, except that the value of the error-status field is genErr and the value of the error-index field is the index of said object name component in the received message.
|If none of the foregoing rules apply, then the receiving protocol entity sends to the originator of the received message the GetResponse-PDU such that, for each object named in the variable- bindings field of the received message, the corresponding component of the GetResponse-PDU represents the name and value of that variable. The value of the error- status field of the GetResponse- PDU is noError and the value of the error-index field is zero. The value of the request-id field of the GetResponse-PDU is that of the received message.

|The GetResponse-PDU
|The form of the GetResponse-PDU is identical to that of the GetRequest-PDU except for the indication of the PDU type.
|The GetResponse-PDU is generated by a protocol entity only upon receipt of the GetRequest-PDU, GetNextRequest-PDU, or SetRequest-PDU, as described elsewhere in this document.
|Upon receipt of the GetResponse-PDU, the receiving protocol entity presents its contents to its SNMP application entity.

|The form of the GetNextRequest-PDU is identical to that of the GetRequest-PDU except for the indication of the PDU type. In the ASN.1 language: The GetNextRequest-PDU is generated by a protocol entity only at the request of its SNMP application entity. Upon receipt of the GetNextRequest-PDU, the receiving protocol entity responds according to any applicable rule in the list below:
|1. If, for any object name in the variable-bindings field, that name does not lexicographically precede the name of some object available for get operations in the relevant MIB view, then the receiving entity sends to the originator of the received message the GetResponse-PDU of identical form, except that the value of the error-status field is noSuchName, and the value of the error-index field is the index of said object name component in the received message.
|2. If the size of the GetResponse-PDU generated as described below would exceed a local limitation, then the receiving entity sends to the originator of the received message the GetResponse-PDU of identical form, except that the value of the error-status field is tooBig, and the value of the error-index field is zero.
|3. If, for any object named in the variable-bindings field, the value of the lexicographical successor to the named object cannot be retrieved for reasons not covered by any of the foregoing rules, then the receiving entity sends to the originator of the received message the GetResponse-PDU of identical form, except that the value of the error-status field is genErr and the value of the error-index field is the index of said object name component in the received message.
|If none of the foregoing rules apply, then the receiving protocol entity sends to the originator of the received message the GetResponse-PDU such that, for each name in the variable-bindings field of the received message, the corresponding component of the GetResponse-PDU represents the name and value of that object whose name is, in the lexicographical ordering of the names of all objects available for get operations in the relevant MIB view, together with the value of the name field of the given component, the immediate successor to that value. The value of the error-status field of the GetResponse-PDU is noError and the value of the errorindex field is zero. The value of the request-id field of the GetResponse-PDU is that of the received message.

|The SetRequest-PDU
|The form of the SetRequest-PDU is identical to that of the GetRequest-PDU except for the indication of the PDU type. The SetRequest-PDU is generated by a protocol entity only at the request of its SNMP application entity. Upon receipt of the SetRequest-PDU, the receiving entity responds according to any applicable rule in the list below:

If, for any object named in the variable-bindings field, the object is not available for set operations in the relevant MIB view, then the receiving entity sends to the originator of the received message the GetResponse-PDU of identical form, except that the value of the error-status field is noSuchName, and the value of the error-index field is the index of said object name component in the received message.
|2. If, for any object named in the variable-bindings field, the contents of the value field does not, according to the ASN.1 language, manifest a type, length, and value that is consistent with that required for the variable, then the receiving entity sends to the originator of the received message the GetResponse-PDU of identical form, except that the value of the error-status field is badValue, and the value of the error-index field is the index of said object name in the received message.
|3. If the size of the Get Response type message generated as described below would exceed a local limitation, then the receiving entity sends to the originator of the received message the GetResponse-PDU of identical form, except that the value of the error-status field is tooBig, and the value of the error-index field is zero.
|4. If, for any object named in the variable-bindings field, the value of the named object cannot be altered for reasons not covered by any of the foregoing rules, then the receiving entity sends to the originator of the received message the GetResponse-PDU of identical form, except that the value of the error-status field is genErr and the value of the error-index field is the index of said object name component in the received message.
|If none of the foregoing rules apply, then for each object named in the variable-bindings field of the received message, the corresponding value is assigned to the variable. Each variable assignment specified by the SetRequest-PDU should be effected as if simultaneously set with respect to all other assignments specified in the same message.
|The receiving entity then sends to the originator of the received message the GetResponse-PDU of identical form except that the value of the error-status field of the generated message is noError and the value of the error-index field is zero.

|The introduction and usage of SIP within the IPMS system is to allow setup of IP multimedia sessions (eg telephony call).
|
|The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is an application-layer control  (signaling) protocol for creating, modifying and terminating sessions with one or more participants. These sessions include Internet multimedia conferences, Internet telephone calls and multimedia distribution. 
|SIP invitations used to create sessions carry session descriptions which allow participants to agree on a set of compatible media types.  SIP supports user mobility by proxying and redirecting requests to the user's current location. Users can register their current location.  SIP is not tied to any particular session control protocol.
