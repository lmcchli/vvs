<P>The delayline package implements a way to forget about an object until a later time. A delay line is a sequence of delays. An object inserted into the input end of the delay line will pop out of the delay line after each delay, as a reminder that it needs attention. You can delay objects that implement Delayable. The notifications when an object pops out is send to a DelayEventListener.</P>
<P>The function of this package is modelled after the behaviour of the hardware component delay line, which delays an input signal, so it appears with different delays at different taps on the component.</P>
