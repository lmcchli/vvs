  This package contains classes used to schedule information for later handling.
  
  Threads are used in several places in the package. The DBDelayHandler uses
  a thread to get the next message to schedule or reschedule. The same
  thread watches the currently scheduled messages and knows when
  it is time to send out a notification.
