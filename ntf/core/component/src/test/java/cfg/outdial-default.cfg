#
# This file defines the outdial state machine so that it behaves close
# to how outdial has done before in NTF.
# That is:
#    SMS Type 0 is sent at the start of the sequence and only there
#    Unrecoverable errors aborts the outdial sequence
#    Other problems leads to a wait and a retry
#    Up to four  attempts might be made
#    Fallback is triggered after unrecoverable failed attempts
#    After four noanswer/notreachable in a row a fallback is triggered
#
#    An outdial might go on for up to a week (if busy all the time, or
#      long time until the phone was on)
#    Fallback is triggered if that time was exceeded
#

#	404	No reply *
#	405	Not reachable *
#	408	Call attempt timed out
#	421	Service not available
#	500	Internal communication failure towards MAS
#	501	Internal communication failure towards MAS
#	502	Resource limit exceeded
#	512	Non valid phonenumber
#	513	Call attempt failed
#	514	No mailbox
#	603	Busy *
#	610	No reply *
#	613	Not reachable *
#	614	Suppressed call *

#
#	The codes 601-634 except the ones listed above can be configured by MAS.
#	* The 4XX codes marked by * could be replaced by 6XX in some customer adaptions
#	of MAS
#
# Note: The time for the "wait" command should be a multiple of 1 minute because
#       the timer has a one minute granularity.
