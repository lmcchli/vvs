    <!-- there was a bug (TR 27742) causing the transfer to almost be executed once again when a hangup event was thrown during transfer.
    The "counter" variable is used as a side effect in this test case, to check that stuff is not run twice.

    With "almost" I mean that much of what is done up to sending the dialog.transfer to CCXML was executed twice, but by coincedence
    the sending of dialog.transfer happened just once.-->
