To be able to compile sipp, you need to following packages :

libgcrypt-devel-1.2.2-13.2.x86_64.rpm
libgpg-error-devel-1.0-16.4.x86_64.rpm
libnet-1.1.2.1-18.2.x86_64.rpm
libpcap-0.9.4-12.4.1.x86_64.rpm
openssl-0.9.8a-18.26.x86_64.rpm
openssl-devel-0.9.8a-18.26.x86_64.rpm
util-linux-crypto-devel-2.12a-14.15.x86_64.rpm

if time permits, I'll try to add their compilation in the sipp Makefile.

to compile run : make pcapplay_ossl
