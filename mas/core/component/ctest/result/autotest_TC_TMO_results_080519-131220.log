# Test on MAS DP5.006 in lab w/o iMux.
# All testcases but the three below was executed using the autotest 
# script. As can be seen when the tc:s were executed 
# individually they worked perfect. It has not been investigagted why 
# they failed when executed in the autotest script.

root@jumpstart # ./starfish_engine.sh TC_TMO/tc_tmo_1.sh 
Result from test: Passed: Verify that the called party information is retrieved from the request URI: 1
root@jumpstart # ./starfish_engine.sh TC_TMO/tc_tmo_18.sh
